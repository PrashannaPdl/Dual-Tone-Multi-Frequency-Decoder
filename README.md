# Dual-Tone-Multi-Frequency-Decoder
This MATLAB code decodes Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals (like telephone keypad tones) using the Goertzel Algorithm for frequency detection.
DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) is the technology behind telephone touch-tone signals, where each key corresponds to two specific frequencies.

This project:
-Detects DTMF tones in a given signal.
-Uses the Goertzel Algorithm (efficient for single-frequency detection).
-Works even with added noise.
-Plots time-domain & frequency-domain results.
